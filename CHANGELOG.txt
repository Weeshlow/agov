  held separately on Drupal.org. This effectively enables proper security

  enable this module.

  compatible with ISM April 2014
- The "Manage Display" tab is now generally hidden
- The Redirect 403 to User Login module has been added
- Global Redirect has been added and is enabled on new installs

  Google Analytics, Honeypot and Libraries

Fixes
- The Contact Page was sometimes not visible to anonymous users

Other notes

  tools
